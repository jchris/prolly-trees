base.js is a library that provides classes and functions for representing and storing entries, entry lists, and nodes in a data structure. It uses [multiformats/block](https://github.com/multiformats/block) library to encode data.

Classes
-------

### Entry

`Entry` is a class that represents an entry in a data structure. It has two properties, `key` and `address`, that can be set via the constructor. It also has `codec` and `hasher` properties which are optional.

### EntryList

`EntryList` is a class that represents a list of `Entry` instances. It has two properties, `entries` and `closed`, that can be set via the constructor. It also has several methods for finding entries based on the `key` property:

*   `find(key, compare)` returns the first entry in the list whose key matches the given key.
*   `findMany(keys, compare, sorted = false, strict = false)` returns all entries in the list that match the keys in the given `keys` array.
*   `findRange(start, end, compare)` returns all entries in the list that have keys between `start` and `end`.

### Node

`Node` is a class that represents a node in a data structure. It has several properties, including `entryList`, `chunker`, `distance`, `getNode`, `compare`, and `cache`, that can be set via the constructor. It also has several methods for finding and retrieving entries:

*   `getEntry(key, cids = new CIDCounter())` returns the first entry in the node whose key matches the given key.
*   `getAllEntries(cids = new CIDCounter())` returns all entries in the node.

Functions
---------

*   `stringKey(key)` returns the string representation of the given `key`.

Usage
-----

Here's an example of how to use the classes and functions in the base.js library:

javascriptCopy code

```js
import { Entry, EntryList, Node } from './base.js'
import { CIDCounter } from './utils.js'

const entries = [
  new Entry({ key: 'key1', address: 'address1' }),
  new Entry({ key: 'key2', address: 'address2' })
]

const entryList = new EntryList({ entries, closed: true })

const chunker = ...
const distance = ...
const getNode = ...
const compare = ...
const cache = ...

const node = new Node({ entryList, chunker, distance, getNode, compare, cache })

const result = node.getEntry('key1')
console.log(result)
```

In this example, we first import the `Entry`, `EntryList`, and `Node` classes from the base.js library. We also import the `CIDCounter` class from the `utils.js` file.

Next, we create an array of `Entry` instances and use it to create an `EntryList` instance.

We then create a `Node` instance with the properties `entryList`, `chunker`, `distance`, `getNode`, `compare`, and `cache`.

Finally, we call the `getEntry` method on the `node` instance to retrieve an entry with a given key.
